# LeetCode C Projects

This repository contains C implementations of various LeetCode problems, organized into separate branches.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Branches

Each problem has its own dedicated branch:

| Problem Name         | Branch Name        | Description                                    |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Two Sum (#1)        | `feature/two-sum`  | Find two numbers that add up to a given target. |
| Palindrome Number (#9) | `feature/palindrome-number` | Check if an integer is a palindrome. |

## ðŸ›  How to Switch to a Project

To view or work on a specific problem, switch to its branch using:

```bash
git checkout feature/two-sum  # Switch to Two Sum branch
git checkout feature/palindrome-number  # Switch to Palindrome Number branch
